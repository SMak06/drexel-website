            <p>There is an urgent need for understanding how life unfolds across the lifespan for people on the autism spectrum. Medical and clinical interventions are vital. But we must also learn about the experiences that help or hinder quality of life for people on the autism spectrum, their families, and our communities. Experiences such as transition into adulthood, employment and continued education, living arrangements, and community participation are understudied.</p>

              </li>
              <li style="color:#4286f4">Resource Development: The outreach and resource services available through ASERT connect existing resources and pockets of expertise, and help address regional gaps in effective services and supports. The ASERT Collaborative has created a library of resources in a variety of topics that are available on the ASERT website (paautism.org). Topics include: transportation, justice, safety, physical health, mental health, and more.
              </li>
              <li style="color:#4286f4">Statewide Resource Center and Website: Through the toll-free number, individuals, professionals, families and community members can contact the ASERT Resource Center and get connected with a Resource Specialist who can provide access to available resources by region and statewide. To contact a Resource Specialist, call 877-231-4244 or email info@paautism.org.  The website is a central resource for families, providers, community members, and self-advocates, and allows you to access a broad array of information to help meet the needs of those living with or serving people with autism via the Internet. The website is an integral part of ASERT’s effort to broaden outreach to individuals with and affected by autism. The website hosts an online resource database and is continually updated with news, events, and trainings.
              </li>
              <li style="color:#4286f4">Data Analysis: The Pennsylvania Autism Census and Pennsylvania Autism Needs Assessment data can be customized and catered data requests are available. Contact info@paautism.org to request specific data or reports.
              </li>
              <li style="color:#4286f4">Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) Module Training Series: All Behavioral Health-Managed Care Organizations and providers enrolled in the Medical Assistance (MA) Program who provide behavioral health rehabilitation services (BHRS) to children under age 21 must obtain training and certification from Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuses Services (OMHSAS). This includes the Bureau of Autism Services: Office of Developmental Program (BAS: ODP) Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) Training. The ASERT Collaborative, in collaboration with BAS: ODP, is developingweb-based FBA training modules that will build capacity, reach a larger audience, ensure content comprehension and retention of training material, and ensure a level of competency verify ability of the practitioner  after training, and measure practitioners’ ability to maintain fidelity & track effectiveness of the training itself.
              </li>
              <li style="color:#4286f4">The Pennsylvania Autism Needs Assessment: The 2017 Pennsylvania Autism Needs Assessment is a follow up to the 2011 Pennsylvania Autism Needs Assessment.  The information collected will help stakeholders across Pennsylvania to better understand and work to address the changing needs of individuals impacted by autism. The Pennsylvania Autism Needs Assessment seeks to understand the needs of people with autism and their families as this population continues to grow and change. A website that will house results, reports, and other data analysis and information learned from the 2017 Pennsylvania Autism Needs Assessment is in progress.

              <li style="color:#4286f4">Pennsylvania Autism Census: In 2005, the Bureau of Autism Services within the PA Department of Human Services commissioned an administrative census of the number of individuals with autism receiving services in Pennsylvania. The 2014 Pennsylvania Autism Census Update was released in fall 2014 by the PA Department of Human Services, led by the ASERT Collaborative. The Pennsylvania Autism Census is an administrative count of the number of individuals who are receiving services in public service systems. The 2014 PA Autism Census Update used data from multiple Pennsylvania systems. The full report, previous report, and a clickable map by county are available at www.paautism.org/census.
              </li>
              <li style="color:#4286f4">Adult Community Autism Program (ACAP) and Adult Autism Waiver (AAW) Focus Groups: The Bureau of Autism Services (BAS) commissioned the ASERT Collaborative to conduct a series of focus groups in 2013-2014 to engage the two current BAS programs: the Adult Autism Waiver (AAW) and the Adult Community Autism Program (ACAP). ASERT facilitated focus groups with individuals who directly interact with these programs including: individuals with autism, families, service providers, and program administrators. Through these focus groups ASERT gathered detailed knowledge about their experiences with AAW and ACAP. The results of this project informed program planning and helped to bridge program engagement with BAS, ASERT and service providers. Results of this initiative were communicated to individuals and families through community meetings and a formal report. In late 2015, ASERT conducted a second round of ACAP focus groups to learn if and how program experiences have changed since the first focus groups.

              <li style="color:#4286f4">State Policy Summit: Innovations in Adult Programming: The inaugural Policy Summit: Innovations in Adult Programming, sponsored by the Autism Services, Education, Resources, and Training Collaborative (ASERT) was held in Philadelphia in March 2016. The Policy Summit brought together experts from across the United States who specialize in programs and policy development and implementation for adults with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, other developmental disabilities, and mental health diagnoses.
